## FA Module

**Path:** [Predict-Emotion/FA](https://github.com/Mohana-Sree/Predict-Emotion/tree/master/FA)
This module implements an API using FastAPI for emotion prediction, likely integrating a machine learning model under the hood.

Features
RESTful API for serving emotion prediction requests.

Built with FastAPI for high performance and easy integration.

Suitable for deployment in real-time systems.

### Setup & Usage

*Note: Specific setup instructions are not provided in the repository. The following is a general guideline.*

1. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, such as OpenCV, dlib, and scikit-learn.

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python dlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Run the Application:** Navigate to the `FA` directory and execute the main script.

   ```bash
   cd FA
   python main.py
   ```

## Maven1 Module

**Path:** [Predict-Emotion/Maven1](https://github.com/Mohana-Sree/Predict-Emotion/tree/master/Maven1)

### Description

The `Maven1` module appears to be a Java-based implementation, possibly utilizing Maven for project management. It might focus on a different aspect of emotion prediction, such as textual analysis or integration with other systems.

### Features

* Java-based emotion prediction algorithms
* Modular design for integration with other applications
* Potential use of NLP techniques for text-based emotion detection

### Setup & Usage

*Note: Specific setup instructions are not provided in the repository. The following is a general guideline.*

1. **Install Maven:** Ensure Maven is installed on your system.

   ```bash
   mvn -v
   ```

2. **Build the Project:** Navigate to the `Maven1` directory and build the project using Maven.

   ```bash
   cd Maven1
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:** Execute the compiled application.([GitHub][2])

   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
   ```
